Precious Plastic Dublin is a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste and pollution in Dublin. As part of the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com) global movement, we aim to bring plastic recycling closer to the local community, enabling the public to transform their own waste, while demonstrating the remaining value of plastic waste.

# Note about Re-turn scheme: All bottle caps from the Re-turn scheme should stay within the Re-turn scheme. Please see [Re-turn.ie](https://re-turn.ie)

# Big News: 
Work on the Ballymun Workshop is almost complete and so we would be very appreciative if all caps could be sent there from now on.
Please send all caps to: Precious Plastic Dublin @ Ballymun Youthreach Beside Library, Ballymun Road, Dublin 11.(But please note Ballymun is closed for the summer until August 26th)
