Living sustainably can be a challenge, with a complex range of choices we can make to lighten our impact on the Earth. What actions can we take ourselves at home, at work, and in our community? 

Our first official appearance with an info stand was at the [Sustainable Living Fair](https://www.facebook.com/events/national-botanic-gardens-of-ireland/sustainable-living-fair/292147068358956/) on the 11th of May 2019 in the [National Botanical Garden](http://botanicgardens.ie/), Glasnevin. We were among many other amazing exhibitors like [Refill Ireland](https://refill.ie/), the [Rediscovery Centre](http://www.rediscoverycentre.ie/about-us/) and [Seal Rescue Ireland](http://www.sealrescueireland.org/), just naming a few.

Celia from our team also had a soap box talk inviting people to join us and support our movement.
