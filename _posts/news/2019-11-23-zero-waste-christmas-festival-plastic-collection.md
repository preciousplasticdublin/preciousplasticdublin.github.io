### What can I bring for recycling?

Precious Plastic Dublin will bring you the latest updates about our activities and we'll have collection points for the following types of plastic at our info stand:

- **HDPE bottle caps**
- **Green PET bottles**
- **Crisp packets**
- **Biscuit, cracker and cake wrappers**

#### HDPE bottle caps 

We accept clean and dry HDPE bottle caps from drinking bottles, milk jugs, and drinking cartons which we  recycle locally in Dublin. The first batch of bottle caps we collect will be used to test our machines for shredding end extruding first prototypes for future products. You can read more about what we are planning to do in our recent [blog post about our HDPE bottle cap collection project](/collecting-hdpe-bottle-caps-recycling/).

#### Green PET bottles

Together with [Dr. Emmanual Reynaud](https://twitter.com/ReynaudEmmanuel) from UCD we will collect all sizes of green PET bottles for upcycling into Christmas trees and Christmas decoration. Don't miss out on the Upcycling Workshop with Emmanuel at 14:30 in the workshop room upstairs.

#### Crisp packets

We will collect all brands of crisps packages for recycling with [Terracycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-GB/brigades/crisppacket) in the UK. Crisp multipack outer packaging is accepted. Please do not fold the crisp packets into triangles. Please make sure your packets are completely empty before dropping them off. We unfortunately cannot accept packaging that still contains residual food.
