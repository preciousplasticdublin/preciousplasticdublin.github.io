We have launched a GoFundMe campaign to bring Precious Plastic to Dublin. In Stage 1 we are raising money to build a shredder and an extrusion machine. Every small donation and share on Social Media really helps. Thanks, folks!

If you can donate a few bobs, you can head to our [GoFundMe page here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/precious-plastic-dublin-stage-1?pc=wd_md_campimage_r). Any share or mention is also very much appreciated and worth as much as a donation to us. We'd really like to get the word out and get more enthusiastic people involved! 

## About Precious Plastic

Precious Plastic  is an initiative that was started in the Netherlands in 2013 by Dave Hakkens, with the goal of empowering people to turn everyday plastic waste into valuable products. This has been achieved by making designs for various recycling machines available on an “open source” basis, alongside a supportive online community and makers. Today,  Precious Plastic groups have become established all over the world.

We all know about the scourge of waste plastic and the environmental damage caused by it, yet many people don’t know the full story of plastic recycling in Ireland, or what they can practically do about it. For example, which plastics can be (economically) recycled, which get dumped or incinerated and what resources are used to ship plastic waste to the point of recycling?

## Bringing Precious Plastic to Dublin

Precious Plastic Dublin  is a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste and pollution in Dublin. As part of the 'Precious Plastic’ global movement, we aim to bring plastic recycling closer to the local community, enabling the public to transform their own plastic waste, while demonstrating the potential value of plastic waste. 

Our aim is to establish a Precious Plastic workshop in Dublin and to make it accessible to the local community, to educate people regarding how plastics can be recycled and to facilitate and inspire them to make their own valuable products from recycled plastics.

## Our funding goals
