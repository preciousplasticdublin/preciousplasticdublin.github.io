Chris is a dedicated outdoors person and social entrepreneur who likes to get stuck into any project that helps the environment. Having spent time in the IT industry whilst also running a surfboard repairs/crafts workshop, he's taken on the role of sustainable watercraft educator. His mission is to make environmentally friendly surfcrafts whilst also teaching people how to do the same for themselves. You can find Chris on his [facebook page 'Surfcraft'](https://www.facebook.com/surfservices/), or on the beach/mountains picking up plastic and thinking of ways to upcycle it!
