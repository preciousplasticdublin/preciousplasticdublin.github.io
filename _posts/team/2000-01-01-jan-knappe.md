During the day, Jan is an Environmental Scientist interested in everything related to sustainable and low-cost water treatment. At night (when is not out dumpster diving), Jan is haunted by nightmares about all the single-use plastic that enters our oceans through polluted rivers and streams. To be able to finally sleep again in peace one day, he joined the Precious Plastic Dublin time from the first hour. You can also find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JanKnappe) or check out his [personal blog](https://www.janknappe.com).
