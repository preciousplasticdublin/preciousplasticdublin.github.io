Fed up with plastic waste and the lack of real recycling solutions available in Ireland, Sinead was very excited to learn about Precious Plastic. While she'd prefer if there was less plastic in the world to begin with, she hopes that if people can see the value remaining in their plastic garbage they may be less inclined to throw it away. By day Sinead works in campaigning and community organising. She would love to see a Precious Plastic workshop in every town across the country!
