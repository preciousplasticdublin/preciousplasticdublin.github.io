During the day, Jan is an Environmental Scientist interested in everything related to sustainable and low-cost water treatment. At night (when he is not out dumpster diving), Jan is haunted by nightmares about all the single-use plastic that enters our oceans through polluted rivers and streams. And to finally sleep in peace again one day, he joined the Precious Plastic Dublin team. You can find Jan on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JanKnappe) or check out his [blog](https://www.janknappe.com).
