Richard has a background in IT and education but his thoughts never stray too far from environmental issues. He believes technology and education can help us manoeuvre away from our current unsustainable trajectory. He sees Precious Plastic, which he joined in July 2019, as a prime example of this by providing some solutions to our plastic problems and also helping people learn more about that ubiquitous material which we encounter so often in our daily lives.
