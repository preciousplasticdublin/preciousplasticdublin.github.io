Wouter is a jack of all trades, studied industrial science, sports and physical education, journalism, business management and web design. Just like Jan, a victim of endless worrying about environmental issues, he links social behaviour, excessive consumerism and economic greed with the upcoming environmental crisis. Wouter is an active volunteering member of [Friends of the Earth](https://www.foe.ie/) since 2017, organizer of the [Sick of Plastic Campaign](https://www.changex.org/ie/sickofplastic) in Dublin 8 since 2018. Wouter is part of the finance team here at Precious Plastic Dublin and hopes that one day all humans will realise that the Earth is far more precious than they currently think. The Earth does not need us, but we do need her.
