Wouter is a jack of all trades, studied industrial science, sports and physical education, journalism, business management and web design. Just like Jan, a victim of endless worrying about environmental issues, he links social behaviour, excessive consumerism and economic greed with the upcoming environmental crisis. Wouter is an active volunteering member of [Friends of the Earth](https://www.foe.ie/) since 2017, organizer of the [Sick of Plastic Campaign](https://www.changex.org/ie/sickofplastic) in Dublin 8 since 2018. A Precious Plastic Dublin, Wouter is part of the finance team and hopes that one day all humans will realise that the Earth is far more precious than we currently think.
