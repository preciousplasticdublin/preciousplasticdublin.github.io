Having worked as a supply chain manager in grocery retailing for many years, Bernd saw the amount of packaging and single use plastic used first hand. Having moved from Germany to Ireland recently he had to realise that the consumption of single use plastic per head is even higher here. Being conscious about the environment and trying to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle himself he stumbled over Precious Plastic Dublin at the [Zero Waste Festival](https://www.zerowastefestival.ie/) and joined the team to see what difference he can make.
