Anna is a humanist and tries to help people in different ways. She believes that kindness and healthy living is the foundation of happiness and a base for healthy living is a clean environment. Professionally, she sells energy analytics platforms for large consumers to help reduce their energy use, practices yoga and mindfulness. She tries to inspire people to adopt a more reflected plastic consumption because she knows for sure that a big change in the world consists of [a million small changes](https://www.thealternative.org.uk/dailyalternative/2017/8/16/its-so-not-enough-just-to-scare-people-about-climate-change). Anna believes in people and that we are on the right path to become more conscious and knowledgeable about all the precious uses of plastic.
