Sean has been working in IT for 15 years. He loves messing around with computers and electronics and taking longs walks on beaches picking up plastic as he goes to feed our hungry shredder. Sean is passionate about the environment and wants to help in any way he can to reduce the impact plastic is having on our planet and promote the idea that plastic is precious and should be treated so.
