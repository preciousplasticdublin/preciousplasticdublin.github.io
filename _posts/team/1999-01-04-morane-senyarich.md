Morane believes that often people want to do the right thing for the environment, but simply donâ€™t have the option! This is why she joined Precious Plastic Dublin, with the hope to close the loop of plastic consumption in Dublin by giving the right tools to the community. Growing up in the [French countryside](https://travel.usnews.com/gallery/15-beautiful-places-to-visit-in-the-french-countryside), she is passionate about nature since childhood. She studied Agricultural Sciences, Waste and Water Management and tries to do her humble part in protecting our planet in her daily job.
