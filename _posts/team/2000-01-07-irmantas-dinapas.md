Irmantas is a crackerjack of the construction and logistics industry. There is no job too big or too small for him if it needs to get done. For the past year, he has also been involved with [The Ladder](https://theladder.io/), an accelerator for social enterprises working towards achieving our global [SDGâ€™s](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/) where Irmantas is very keen on supporting projects with environmental focus such as [Evoccoo](https://twitter.com/evocco?lang=en) and the [Bee Sanctuary Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/beesanctuaryireland/). He joined the Precious Plastic Dublin team from the first hour as he is super keen on learning more about the technologies behind plastic recycling on a small and large scale.
