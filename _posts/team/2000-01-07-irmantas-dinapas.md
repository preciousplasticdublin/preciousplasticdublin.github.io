Irmantas is a crackerjack of the construction and logistics industry. There is no job too big or too small for him if it needs to get done. For the past year, He is also involved with [The Ladder](https://theladder.io/), an accelerator for social enterprises involved with achieving our global [SDGâ€™s](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/) where Irmantas is very keen on getting involved with environmental projects such as [Evoccoo](https://twitter.com/evocco?lang=en) and the [Bee Sanctuary Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/beesanctuaryireland/). He joined the Precious Plastic Dublin team from the first hour as he is super learning more about the technologies behind plastic recycling on a small and large scale.
