Celia is our organiser and democratically elected decision maker. She has been intensively involved with the Zero Waste movement in Ireland for the last couple of years and is trying to live a low waste lifestyle. Her day job revolves around making sense of the Irish and European packaging waste statistics. In the rare occasion that she actually does create some plastic waste, she would prefer to upcycle it herself locally than shipping it off into the unknown. In her professional life, she tries to. You can follow her Zero Waste Adventures on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/) and [blog](http://www.celiasomlai.com).
